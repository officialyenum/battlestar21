## Technologies
-   [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) - Runtime Environment
-   [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.
-   [AI21 LABS](https://studio.ai21.com/overview) - AI21 Labs is an AI lab & product company whose mission is to re-imagine the way we read and write by making the machine a thought partner to humans.

## Getting Started


### Installation

-   git clone [Battle Star 21](https://github.com/officialyenum/battlestar21.git)
-   Run `npm install` to install packages.
-   Run `npm start` to run the application in development mode.

### Usage

This is the basic flow of the application.
-   Generate Your Character
        In this stage, the user designates values for various features of their intended players; each player can have one and only one player at a time. However, they are allowed to generate at most 3 "game characters" throughout the lifetime of the game. To generate a player, the user sets values for the following parameters: 
        1. Player's strength
        2. Player's speed
        3. Player's endurance
        4. 
-   Battle with other Characters through Simulations
-   Get Results after simulations

### Testing
-   No Test Implemented
